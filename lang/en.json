  "mainPom": "This website is one of my first more “complex” works, which didn’t take me too long to realize, but that thought me a lot. Object oriented programming, ES6 syntax and modules are some of the most important concepts I discovered during this project, but I also learnt how to modify the color theme of a website on user click or preference, how to add interactive elements such as music on click and how to  use localstorage. Other than that, I also improved my knowledge on version control tools, GIT in this case, and I also published the website on Netlify. During this project I also had the opportunity to practice with localization, in fact the website supports both English and Italian, feature that I implemented with a simple JSON file which contained the correct version for each language. I think this project made me aware of the multitude of problems a developer must face and overcome in order to achieve its end goal, and it ultimately made me realize that researching and developing solutions is one of my favourite parts of this job.

  "h4Book": "A book manager website, to help you keep track of your reading habits",
  "mainBook": "For this project, I designed and built a CRUD app to manage the user’s book preferences. I used React and Typescript as the main front-end technologies of the website, while for the backend part I choose Firebase, a great tool that I used to implement both Google Login and the user database. The website  also works without logging in, although the preferences are only saved in localStorage; instead, while logging in, the user saves his preferences in the database I created. The user can perfectly manage each one of the three lists I implemented, adding and removing whatever book they want. I used Google Books API to get the fetched data for my site, and this part really helped me strengthen my knowledge on Rest APIs. For the multi-lingual feature of this site, I decided to opt for a more professional tool instead of the JSON file I used in the previous project: i18n. Overall, I think this project has thought me a lot, especially in terms of React, Typescript, Firebase and Restful APIs, technologies which I can now use rather effortlessly.",

  "h4Lcdg": "Kids store website",
  "mainLcdg": "In this third project, I developed a fully functional kids store spotlight website for a client. Other than the usual technologies, I used the NextJS and Strapi. I decided to use NextJS because I thought a website like this would have been a great use case for Static Site Generation, instead of the Client Side Rendering approach I used for the other two sites, and this for two reasons: the first one is that I wanted a fast website, and NextJS was able to accomplish this, thanks to it’s built in features, like generating HTML only at build time and reusing it at each request (good for SEO too) and Images Optimization. The second reason is that a website like this needed to be as SEO friendly as possible, and so Client Side Rendering was not an option. Another tool I opted for is Strapi, which I useds to create a CMS interface for the site admin to add new content. The admin, in fact, can add whatever product he wants, as it is an extremely user friendly and efficient platform. I also implemented Google Analytics, and for this reason I also needed to add a cookie consent banner to make the product GDPR compliant. The website is ready, but will officially launch when the new collection will be released to public, in August.",
